# K-Means-Project
For a extra challenge, a professor had us code an image quanitzing algorithm in Java. This program utilizes K-Means clustering of pixels to complete the quanitization. As distance metrics, both squared euclidean distance of pixels and color hue can be used within the K-Means algorithm. The clustering algorithm can be found in ClusteringMapGenerator.java. This program is a great reminder of why Python is often the way to go for these tasks over Java :). For any questions, feel free to reach out to me at cdd43@pitt.edu.
